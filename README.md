## What I'm Building

**Voice Agents.** **Automation Agents.** **Game Agents.**

Breaking things to understand them, then making them work in production.

## Current Focus

- Production voice AI that doesn't collapse under load (Pipecat, WebRTC, AssemblyAI)
- Systems programming in Rust because someone has to do memory management
- Mechanistic interpretability—opening the black box with a crowbar
- Procedural generation experiments (worlds build themselves)

## Tech I Work With

**Languages:** Python for speed, C++ for performance, Rust for when I hate myself  
**ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, LLM wrangling  
**Infrastructure:** Docker containers all the way down, AWS, GCP, Spark/Kafka  
**Voice:** Real-time streaming, WebRTC, making very expensive large predictive models talk  
**Data:** SQL, MongoDB, Voldemort,Cassandra and pretty much all the VectorDBs
**Game Engines:** Unreal, Unity (for when I am reminded how bad the RAM market is)

I like data. I like machines. I like learning.  
Prefer understanding how AI works over just calling APIs.
